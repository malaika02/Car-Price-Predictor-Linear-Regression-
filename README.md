This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting car prices based on various features. The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook using Python.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can estimate the price of a car based on features such as make, model, year, mileage, and other relevant attributes. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
